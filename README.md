## 🏛️ System Architecture & Core Logic

This section provides a deep dive into the technical architecture of the platform's most critical components: the Quality Metrics engine and the Data Pre-processing suite.

### 🎯 The Heart of the Platform: Quality Metrics Analysis (`quality-metrics/page.tsx`)

Dear data enthusiasts, let us unveil the crown jewel of Data-VizAI - our Quality Metrics Analysis engine. This isn't just code; it's a symphony of AI, data processing, and real-time visualization working in perfect harmony.

#### 🧬 Architecture Deep Dive

Our Quality Metrics engine is built on three fundamental pillars:

1. **Hybrid Processing Architecture**
   ```typescript
   interface AnalysisResult {
     overall_score: number;      // 0-100 quality score
     quality_label: string;      // High/Medium/Low classification
     label_probabilities: {      // Confidence scores
       Low: number;
       Medium: number;
       High: number;
     };
     metric_scores: Record<string, number>;  // Individual metric scores
     top_issues: Record<string, number>;     // Priority improvement areas
   }
   ```
   - Frontend orchestration with React + TypeScript
   - Middleware caching layer with MongoDB
   - Distributed ML processing with Flask microservices

2. **Smart Caching Strategy**
   ```javascript
   // Intelligent cache management
   const cacheKey = `${userId}:${datasetId}:metrics`;
   const TTL = 24 * 60 * 60; // 24 hours cache validity
   
   // Progressive loading with fallbacks
   if (cacheHit) {
     return cachedMetrics;
   } else {
     const newMetrics = await calculateMetrics();
     await cache.set(cacheKey, newMetrics, TTL);
   }
   ```

3. **Real-Time Visualization Pipeline**
   - Chart.js integration with custom optimization
   - WebSocket updates for live metric changes
   - Dynamic resizing and responsive layouts

**Core User Workflow & Logic:**

1.  **Initialization**: When the page loads, it first fetches the list of all datasets available to the authenticated user from the internal Next.js API endpoint at `/api/datasets`.

2.  **Dataset Selection**: The user selects a dataset from a dropdown menu. This action triggers the primary function, `handleDatasetChange`.

3.  **Cache-First Strategy**: The system is designed for efficiency. Before performing a costly new analysis, it first queries its own backend at `/api/metrics/get` to check if previously computed metrics for this specific dataset are already cached in MongoDB.
    *   **Cache Hit**: If valid cached metrics are found, they are loaded directly into the state, and the UI is instantly populated. This provides a fast, responsive experience for users re-analyzing data.
    *   **Cache Miss**: If no valid cache exists, the process continues to the next step.

4.  **External Metric Calculation (Flask API)**:
    *   The frontend converts the selected dataset's JSON data into a CSV string format in-memory.
    *   It then makes a `POST` request to the first external machine learning service, a Flask application hosted on Render: **`https://metric-models-dataviz.onrender.com/analyze`**.
    *   This service is responsible for the heavy lifting of calculating the **26+ foundational data quality metrics**. It runs a suite of Python-based data analysis functions to compute everything from `Missing_Values_Pct` and `Duplicate_Records_Count` to `Mean_Median_Drift` and `Feature_Correlation_Mean`.
    *   The Flask API returns a JSON object containing all the calculated metrics.

5.  **State Update & User Action**:
    *   The newly calculated metrics are loaded into the component's state and displayed in the UI, categorized into tabs like "Structure," "Quality," "Statistical," and "Advanced."
    *   Critically, these new metrics are **not yet saved**. The user is presented with a "Save Metrics" button, giving them control over whether to cache this new analysis. Clicking this button sends the data to the `/api/metrics/save` endpoint to be stored in MongoDB.

6.  **Deep Learning Analysis (The "Magic" Step)**:
    *   The user can then click the "Deep Learning Analysis" button. This triggers the `performMLAnalysis` function.
    *   This function assembles the 26+ metrics into a feature vector—a specific numerical input format required by the predictive model.
    *   It then makes a `POST` request to the second external machine learning service, also hosted on Render: **`https://data-viz-ai-model.onrender.com/predict`**. This endpoint hosts the pre-trained **TabNet deep learning model**.
    *   The TabNet model takes the feature vector and returns a rich JSON object containing:
        *   `overall_score`: A final data quality score from 0-100.
        *   `quality_label`: A human-readable classification (`High`, `Medium`, `Low`).
        *   `label_probabilities`: The model's confidence in each quality label.
        *   `top_issues`: The top metrics that negatively impacted the overall score.

7. **Rich Visualization and Insights**:
    *   The results from the TabNet model are used to populate the "Deep Learning Analysis Results" section of the UI. This includes the overall score, quality distribution bars, and a list of critical issues.
    *   The component uses **Chart.js**, managed via `useRef`, to dynamically render a bar chart (`createMetricChart`) visualizing the best and worst-performing metric scores. This chart is fully reactive and updates whenever the data changes or the window is resized.
    *   Finally, the analysis results are passed as props to the `<N8nInsights />` component, which likely uses these structured results to generate even more specific, actionable recommendations for the user.
    *   Throughout this process, an interactive `<Chatbot />`, powered by the Groq API, is available for the user to ask questions and get real-time assistance.

This entire workflow, from data selection to deep learning insight, is managed within a single, powerful React component, making it the true backbone of the application's analytical capabilities.

### 🔧 The Data Surgeon: Pre-processing Engine (`pre-processing/`)

Welcome to the engine room of Data-VizAI! Our Pre-processing Engine is where raw data transforms into analytical gold. Built with a revolutionary "hub-and-spoke" architecture, it's the Swiss Army knife of data cleaning.

#### 🎨 Architectural Canvas

1. **Smart Pipeline Design**
   ```typescript
   interface PreprocessingPipeline {
     steps: Array<{
       id: string;
       operation: 'impute' | 'normalize' | 'encode' | 'clean';
       config: Record<string, any>;
       dependencies: string[];
     }>;
     validation: {
       pre: ValidationRule[];
       post: ValidationRule[];
     };
     optimizations: {
       parallel: boolean;
       caching: boolean;
     };
   }
   ```

2. **Intelligent Workflow Management**
   ```javascript
   // Dynamic step orchestration
   class PreprocessingOrchestrator {
     async process(data: Dataset): Promise<ProcessedDataset> {
       const steps = this.optimizeStepOrder(this.pipeline.steps);
       const results = new Map();
       
       for (const step of steps) {
         if (this.canRunParallel(step)) {
           await this.runParallel(step, data, results);
         } else {
           await this.runSequential(step, data, results);
         }
       }
       
       return this.assembleResults(results);
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Real-time Quality Assurance**
   - Automated data validation
   - Statistical significance testing
   - Format and consistency checks

-   **The Hub (`pre-processing/page.tsx`)**: This page acts as the central dashboard for all pre-processing activities. It likely displays an overview of the selected dataset and provides navigation to the various cleaning tools. It serves as the entry point into the pre-processing workflow.

-   **The Spokes (Individual Task Pages)**: Each subdirectory within `pre-processing` (e.g., `missing-values/`, `outliers/`, `duplicate-records/`) is a "spoke." These are individual Next.js pages dedicated to solving one specific data quality problem.
    *   For example, the page at `/dashboard/pre-processing/missing-values` provides a focused UI for users to select columns with missing data and choose an imputation strategy (e.g., fill with mean, median, or a constant value).
    *   Similarly, `/dashboard/pre-processing/outliers` would provide tools to define outliers (e.g., via Z-score or IQR) and decide how to handle them (remove or cap).

-   **Reusable Building Blocks (`components/` & `context/`)**:
    *   **`BasePreprocessingPage.tsx`**: This is likely a shared component that provides a consistent layout (header, dataset info, action buttons) for all the individual "spoke" pages. This avoids code duplication and ensures a uniform look and feel.
    *   **`PreprocessingOptions.tsx`**: This component probably contains the common UI elements used across different pages, such as column selectors, dropdowns for methods, and input fields for values.
    *   **`PreprocessingContext.tsx`**: A React Context provider that wraps the entire pre-processing section. Its job is to manage the global state of the dataset being worked on. When a user cleans data in one section (e.g., `missing-values`), the context ensures that the updated dataset is available in the next section they visit (e.g., `outliers`), creating a seamless, multi-step data cleaning pipeline.

-   **Backend Integration (`api/preprocessing/[operation]/route.ts`)**: The frontend pre-processing pages communicate with a dynamic API route on the backend. When a user wants to remove duplicates, the frontend sends a request to `/api/preprocessing/duplicate-records`. When they handle outliers, it calls `/api/preprocessing/outliers`. This single dynamic route handles all pre-processing logic on the server, making the backend organized and scalable.

### 🧠 The Brain: AI Insights Engine (`ai-analysis/`)

At the heart of Data-VizAI's intelligence lies our AI Insights Engine - a sophisticated system that transforms raw data into actionable wisdom. This isn't just another analytics tool; it's your AI-powered data scientist.

#### 🎓 Intelligence Architecture

1. **Multi-Model Ensemble System**
   ```python
   class AIInsightEngine:
       def __init__(self):
           self.models = {
               'quality': TabNetQualityModel(),
               'anomaly': IsolationForestModel(),
               'forecasting': ProphetModel(),
               'clustering': BirchModel()
           }
           
       async def analyze(self, dataset: Dataset) -> AIInsights:
           results = {}
           for model_name, model in self.models.items():
               results[model_name] = await model.predict(dataset)
           return self.synthesize_insights(results)
   ```

2. **Natural Language Generation Pipeline**
   ```typescript
   interface InsightGenerator {
     templates: {
       anomaly: string[];
       trend: string[];
       correlation: string[];
       recommendation: string[];
     };
     
     generateInsight(data: AnalysisResult): string {
       const template = this.selectTemplate(data);
       return this.fillTemplate(template, data);
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Real-time Learning System**
   - Continuous model updating
   - User feedback incorporation
   - Adaptive threshold adjustment

4. **Knowledge Graph Integration**

   class KnowledgeGraph {
     nodes: Map<string, DataNode>;
     edges: Map<string, Relationship[]>;
     
     addInsight(insight: AIInsight) {
       this.updateGraph(insight);
       this.pruneObsoleteConnections();
       this.generateNewConnections();
     }
   }
   ```

5. **Automated Decision Support**
   - Pattern recognition
   - Anomaly detection
   - Predictive analytics
   - Prescriptive recommendations

#### 🔄 Workflow Integration

The AI Insights Engine seamlessly integrates with both the Quality Metrics Analysis and Pre-processing Engine:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Raw Data] --> B[Quality Metrics]
    B --> C[AI Insights Engine]
    C --> D[Pre-processing Engine]
    D --> E[Refined Data]
    C --> F[Knowledge Graph]
    F --> G[Recommendation System]
```

This powerful integration ensures that each component enhances the others, creating a self-improving ecosystem that gets smarter with every analysis.
